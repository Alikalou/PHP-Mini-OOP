## PHP 8 OOP Mini Project – LMS Demo

This repository represents a **simple OOP demonstration of a Library Management System (LMS)** written in PHP 8.

The implementation is intentionally **minimal** and not meant to be feature-complete or production-ready. The goal of this project is **learning**, not complexity.

Its main purpose is to serve as an introduction to **PHP 8 object-oriented programming constructs** through a small, self-contained codebase that is easy to read and reason about.

## What This Project Demonstrates

The project focuses on practicing and understanding core OOP concepts in PHP, including:

- Classes and objects  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Traits and interfaces  
- Abstract classes and methods  
- Encapsulation and visibility  
- Basic file handling and object serialization  
- Runtime introspection  

All examples are kept straightforward to emphasize **concept clarity over application logic**.

## Source Code Structure

The `src/` directory contains the actual **OOP constructs and domain classes** used in the project.  
Each folder represents a specific concept or responsibility, such as domain entities, interfaces, traits, and supporting utilities.

The project also includes a small **demo script** that exercises these classes and demonstrates how the different OOP features work together in practice.
