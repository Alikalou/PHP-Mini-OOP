# Mini LMS (PHP 8)

This repository contains a **small Learning Management System (LMS) prototype** implemented in **PHP 8**, designed to demonstrate and apply object-oriented programming principles in a focused, self-contained codebase.

The project is intentionally **scope-limited** and aims to showcase clean OOP design and language features rather than full application complexity or production concerns.

---

## Project Purpose

This project serves as a practical demonstration of **PHP 8 object-oriented programming constructs** through a simple LMS-style domain model.  
The emphasis is on **code clarity, structure, and responsibility separation**, making the system easy to read, understand, and extend.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

The implementation focuses on applying core OOP concepts in PHP, including:

- Classes and objects  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Traits and interfaces  
- Abstract classes and methods  
- Encapsulation and visibility  
- Basic file handling and object serialization  
- Runtime introspection  

All examples are intentionally straightforward to emphasize **conceptual correctness and design clarity** over feature breadth.

## Source Code Structure

The `src/` directory contains the project’s domain entities and supporting OOP constructs.  
Each folder represents a specific responsibility, such as domain models, interfaces, traits, and shared utilities.

A small demo script is included to exercise the system and illustrate how the different OOP components interact at runtime.
